### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi, I'm Alexander Kutepov. I'm a team lead and a just developer, I had created different things in different technologies. Sometimes it was a math or a programming language, sometimes it was an UI and etc. 

Here, inside is something that I can give for the community for the MIT license.

More projects soon... I will release the simulation for the traffic road system for the MIT license.
