### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello everyone, my name is Alexander Kutepov. I am a developer, I have created different things in different technologies. Sometimes it is math and programming language, sometimes it's a UI and etc. 

And I think that all developers  should be athletic, like a philosopher in the ancient Greece. 

And I am looking for a new job.
